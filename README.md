# InfraDrain_Monitoring_System
Infra Drain Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution for urban drainage management.
Utilizes real-time monitoring and intelligent analytics for efficient drainage maintenance.
Equipped with various sensors connected to an ESP32 controller, including:Flow sensor, Tilt sensor, pH sensor,Temperature sensor,Gas sensor.
ESP32 Camera with Edge Impulse Sight captures and processes drainage images.
The smart camera classifies waste materials (e.g., distinguishes paper from plastic).
Combines visual data with sensor readings to detect:Blockages, Contamination, Structural issues
Real-time data transmission to the Blynk application for monitoring.
Interactive dashboard provides system performance insights.
Immediate notifications alert authorities about anomalies for quick action.
Integrates sensor data, machine learning, and cloud connectivity for efficient urban drainage management.
Supports sustainability and risk mitigation to maintain urban infrastructure.
